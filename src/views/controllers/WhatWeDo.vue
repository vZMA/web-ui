			<p>You've heard about flight simulators, right? People from all over the world own flight simulators of varying sizes, from home-based simulators running on modest computers with only a keyboard and mouse to large motion-based simulators with full cockpits. When these people fly their simulators, they often want to increase realism (for fun or educational purposes) by flying together with other pilots in the same virtual airspace. The VATSIM network accommodates this by providing a way to connect simulators together so that pilot Joe can see pilot Sally's airplane. This carries an important implication: when sharing the same airspace, now the planes can crash into each other. This necessitates another type of VATSIM network participant, the air traffic controller.</p>
            <p>Just like people in the real world, some VATSIM participants choose to act solely in the role of a pilot, with some going as far as simulating a pilot's career by earning "ranks" and achievements from a virtual airline employer. Some VATSIM participants chose to act solely in the role of an air traffic controller; these controllers start in "basic training" and take months or even years to progress through the ranks to become certified to work the most complex air traffic control jobs within the VATSIM network. And, some choose to do both. </p>
            <p>Both of these user types come together to facilitate pilots to fly their fake airplanes in a way that is a close approximation of the real world. They often perform flight planning just like a real pilot, follow real world procedures, learn complex new procedures that they might not otherwise have an opportunity to practice, and fly airplanes they might not otherwise have a chance to touch in the real-world. For some VATSIM participants, such as those with disabilities like blindness or other disqualifying conditions, this is the only opportunity to participate in the aviation community.</p>
            <p>But why? It's fun, yes. But it's a community where we learn. We learn to become safer participants in the aviation community. We teach science and geography. We teach communication skills. Through our organizational structures we teach leadership skills. We teach accountability. We teach how to function as part of a team. And for many young people who might be excluded or ostracized from peer groups we provide a community where they can belong.</p>

			<span class="card-title">HOW IT WORKS</span>
			<p>Software running on each simulator's computer sends information to a central server, including the type of airplane, speed, direction, position, and other factors. The server relays that information to the simulator of all other nearby pilots, which allows each pilot to see other airplanes. The same information is shared with users acting as air traffic controllers so that the simulated radar screens they are using can be used to issue guidance to those aircraft according to procedures that are close approximations of the real world.</p>		</div>

			<span class="card-title">WHY DO IT?</span>
			<p>Not for money. The VATSIM network is free- it is funded both by donations and the benevolence of the network founders. The organization is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit in the United States. (More at <a href='https://www.vatsim.net/'>VATSIM</a>.</p>
            <p>Every VATSIM participant is here for a different reason. Casual participants may be slightly interested in airplanes and wonder how they work. Dedicated users might be using VATSIM as an aide to real-world training to reinforce real world procedures and save time and money by learning concepts and ideas at their computer, instead of behind the yoke of an aircraft where it's more expensive and less safe to learn certain lessons. Many of our young people have used their VATSIM careers to launch careers in aviation as airline pilots, real air traffic controllers, aviation mechanics, airport administrators, and Federal agency bureaucrats. To summarize, it's about learning and sharing a passion for aviation with others.</p>

			<p>Please read the passionate words of one of our young participants below who joined the network as a high school student and has parlayed that into a career in aviation.</p>
            <p>A few years ago, I decided to give VATSIM a try for the first time after one of my friends convinced me to download it so that we could start flying online together. Admittedly, I was a little hesitant at the time. I was entirely unaware of the life-changing effects this network would ultimately have on me. Fast forward a few months; I was hooked on VATSIM. I would fly large airliners into bustling airports following real world procedures while making the best use of my time to understand complex instrument procedures that I may have never discovered or practiced otherwise. </p>
            <p>One day I thought to myself, “If I’ve already learned this much just from flying on the network, why not take it one step further and learn how to be a controller?” Maybe then I would finally get some clarity as to what’s actually happening behind the scenes. Without delay, I studied basic air traffic concepts at VATUSA's Academy and decided I would join the Miami ARTCC. I didn’t know it at the time, but this was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made in my life. </p>
            <p>As I progressed through my VATSIM ATC studies at Miami, I quickly met some of the most talented and passionate individuals who truly displayed a love for and knowledge of aviation, both as pilots and controllers. Many of these people already were, or have gone on to become, real-world pilots and air traffic controllers. These people are now close friends whom I interact with on an almost a daily basis. I honestly couldn’t have asked for a better group of people to share my passion for aviation with. </p>
            <p>Today, I am a real world instrument-rated commercial pilot working toward a job with the airlines, I can say with 100% certainty that participating on VATSIM was one of the best choices I made to support my real-world pilot training:
            <ul>
                <li><p>I gained an abundance of aviation knowledge that I would not have learned from my flight school, or even by flying many hours in a real airplane because there’s a chance I would not be exposed to the same scenarios.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>I gained a deep understanding of how the National Airspace System actually functions, and I know what is happening “on the other side of the mic.” 
                </p></li>
                <li><p>I am a safer and better pilot because of this knowledge and context. 
                </p></li>
                <li><p>I received compliments from my real-world aviation instructors who were perplexed by the amount of aviation knowledge I obtained and my expertise on various topics. 
                </p></li>
                <li><p>I was able to fly many real-world cross-country flights, into some of the busiest airspace in the United States, with ease and confidence the entire time because I know exactly what’s happening around me. 
                </p></li>
                <li><p>I have put my full faith into the knowledge I’ve gained over the years (a significant portion of which came from participation in the VATSIM community) and it has never failed me. 
                </p></li>

            </ul></p>
            <p>I do not believe I would be nearly as knowledgeable or safe of an aviator as I am today without VATSIM, and I owe it to those who’ve volunteered their time, knowledge, and energy to support me during my journey. </p>
            <p>For anyone considering joining VATSIM, please know how much I encourage you to at least dip your toes into the water. It’s free, and low commitment, and it just might change your life or your career trajectory. It’s not a video game- it’s a community where aviation enthusiasts and practitioners come together to deepen their understanding of the career or hobby they love so much.</p>
            <p>It has been my privilege to make lifelong friends who inspire me to be the best I can. I wouldn’t be even half the aviator I am today without such a supportive network to learn on. I still go back and thank that friend who first introduced me to VATSIM. I have no regrets, and I’m confident anyone serious enough about learning aviation either as a career or hobby, who really puts their time and effort into learning how to fly or control on VATSIM, will have no regrets either.</p>
